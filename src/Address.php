 * Also, to access the database, this class uses aryelgois\utils\Database to

 * provide your method for database errors, accordingly to your project needs.

 * @see https://www.github.com/aryelgois/utils
 *
 * Even though, some fields aren't available in the database and you need to set
 * them. These are for a more local information and should be provided by your
 * clients.
